First time doing this but hope it's correct, 
ji downloaded the MATVT from virtesh and went 
through the steps carefully set the cursor 
size and speed left everything else alone 
but when I went to my browser to use it
 it ended up not being the
 default 164  no volume key 
it glitched to 23 the enter key center of DPad 
and now I'm not able to delete the MATVT
 or use my Android box at all... 
I'm using a simple onn Android box..... 
Please help I just want to watch TV 
without buying a new android box
..........
Am I an idiot and screwed here or what
